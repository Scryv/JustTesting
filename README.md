**GambleGamble** is an interesting way to gamble it doesnt take the basic you give money and get broke or get rich
but instead you gamble your login and password and you location if you lose your data gets put in a database but
if you win you get access to that database

> **FOR LEGAL REASONS** i have to add that we do not condole anything that others make or do with this project **We're just the devs**.
